# WeatherVue
### WeatherVue

**Idea**: Let's use Codeup's Weather Map Project to learn Vue 3. 

**Main Goals**: 

* Practice using Vue for a front end application
* Prepare to teach using VSCode and use that IDE as the main one for the project

**Side Goals**:

* Let's try something fancy with MapBox [learn something new to bring into the lesson]
* Let's do our own Dokku deployment [learn something new to understand the new deployment process better]
* Let's use CSS Grid to not get rusty [don't want bootstrap to have all the fun]
